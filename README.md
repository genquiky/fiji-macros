### FIJI Macros for Visualization

The macros in this repository are designed to create simple visualizations of large sets of images.

A [FIJI](https://fiji.sc/) Macro is a script written in a language called Fiji Macro Language, which is based on JavaScript. Fiji is an open-source image processing package based on [ImageJ2](https://imagej.net) that is widely used in scientific research, particularly in the fields of biology and medicine, providing additional features and tools for image analysis.

Fiji Macros allow users to automate repetitive tasks, perform complex image processing operations, and analyse data in a more efficient and reproducible manner. These macros can be used to control various aspects of Fiji, including image acquisition, processing, and analysis.
This scripts includes error checking to handle any issues with loading images from subfolders and garbage management.

----

### * Average Color 3.1
This macro processes the average color of an image.

### * Change-size
Change size of images, replacing the file. This macro batch processes all the files in a folder/subfolders.

### * Image Measure 5.1
It measures stv/med/dev of Brightness, Hue and Saturation statistics of every image and exports to a .txt file.

### * Image Montage 2.2
Create a montage of images with customizable dimensions, scaling, labeling, and color options. The scaled images are then aligned next to each other to form a composite montage. 

### * Image Plot 1.1
Visualize collections of images using a custom UI.

### * Image Slice 2.1
Samples image slices from image sets, composites them, and optionally animates the results.
